## Call to Action

The [Action](https://github.com/HarrisonOfTheNorth/Actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/cmake-hello-world.yml) file for this project is building as follows:

# CMake Hello World

Buckle down, it's 'Monkey-See, Monkey-Do' time!

- Follow the instructions, line by line, however if you are not on a Mac, you will have to accommodate the slight platform differences.

There's also an advanced section at the bottom to show how to use a Github Content Integration (CI) pipeline, to build and then execute the C++ file!

The current status is reported in the Call-to-Action badge above, which reports the result after every commit.

## Overview

- Keep in mind when you do the following 'Monkey-See, Monkey-Do', that the object of the CMakeLists.txt file is to auto generate a Makefile, and that having done so, and also having navigated into the Makefile's directory, when you run `make`, that it should output an executable file in the build/debug directory that you can then execute.

## Instructions

- Create a project directory and in terminal, navigate into it.
- Create a main.cpp project shell.

`main.cpp`

```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}
```

- run `cmake --version` and record the version number. We got `3.21.4`.
- If you did not get a result, install CMake and repeat the last line.
- Create a file called CMakeLists.txt and put the following content in it (but using your own version number):

`CMakeLists.txt`

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.21.4)
project(MyProjectName)
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
```

- create a build path, we did `mkdir -p build/debug`
- Run `cmake -S . -B build/debug`, realising that `-S` stands for source directory, and `-B` stands for build directory. You can call this command from anywhere, so long as you get the paths right.
- Change into the source directory, in our case it was `cd build/debug`
- Run `make`
- Execute the executable, in our case we ran `./MyProjectName`, which was the name we specified above in our CMakeLists.txt file
- The output should be `Hello World!`
- Look around, find an ape, and get him to pat you on the back. I learnt this exactly the same way!

## Next Step

- In the build/debug directory, run `make clean` and notice that your executable is now gone.
- As the `-S` points to your source directory, and the `-B` points to your build directory, create a `src` directory, move both the `main.ccp` file and `CMakeLists.txt` file into it, and from the project root directory, run `cmake -S src -B build/debug`.
- Navigate back into the build directry, run `make`, and execute the executable again.

## Be a Monkey Prince

- If you check your project into your own GitHub account, you can configure it to build, every time you commit - and it will report a success or failure!
- We go the extra mile here by piping the output ('Hello World!) to a text file, which is then uploaded as an attachment to the (not publicly visible) job build page.

![example workflow](https://github.com/HarrisonOfTheNorth/CMake-Hello-World/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml/badge.svg)

This badge above indicates the current build-status of main.cpp, and the [Workflow Action File](https://github.com/HarrisonOfTheNorth/Actions/blob/master/.github/workflows/cmake-hello-world.yml) is as follows, which you too can set up.

```
name: C++ CMake-Hello-World Build

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository content
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # Checkout the repository content to github runner.
      - name: tree
        run: tree
      - name: cmake
        run: cmake -S CMake-Hello-World/src -B CMake-Hello-World/build/debug
      - name: tree
        run: tree
      - name: make
        run: make -C CMake-Hello-World/build/debug
      - name: tree
        run: tree
      - name: run executable
        run: (cd CMake-Hello-World/build/debug && ./MyProjectName)
      - name: Upload Artefact
        run: (cd CMake-Hello-World/build/debug && ./MyProjectName) > CMake-Hello-World/helloworld.txt
      - name: tree
        run: tree
      - name: Hello Secret
	run: echo $HELLOSEC
	env:
	  HELLOSEC: ${{ secrets.HELLO_SECRET_KEY }}
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2 # Uploads the path to the Action Build Output screen, with the name identified in name
        with:
          name: my-artifact
          path: CMake-Hello-World/helloworld.txt

```

I put extensive tree commands in so that I can look at the output file, when it does not build, to see where the problem occurred.

Guess what the build output is:

`Hello World!`

_... exactly what main.cpp outputs!_

- But wait, there's a bonus!

If you look at the .yml file, you will see that we also commit a GitHub secret, in a text file, to another branch - [here](https://github.com/HarrisonOfTheNorth/Actions/tree/cmake-hello-world) it is! The secret is inside the file, click on it!
